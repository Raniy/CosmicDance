Opensource Prompting Framework for building adversarial array style chat bots using ChatGPT 3.5 as a base. Expected to be compatible with 4. PROMPT formatting tested now in 4. BUT CHECK TIME AND DATE AND FORK to be sure this method works in public CHATGPT and not just GPT derived using OPENAI API.

Please note all prompts will probably require editing for the specific end use. 
The first tree is the control branch. It determines which version of text from which bot is most appropriate to feed out to the output.

Edit it CAREFULLY.
